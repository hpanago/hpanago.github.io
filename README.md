My site in case you want to find me on Facebook, Twitter, and, if not already viewing this readme, on Github.

##Contributing

If you would like to add a blog post about some of your experiences please do so by opening a pull request.
I prefer to have both .md and .html files for that cause, but you can just write an html one. 
No css. No fancy things.Simplicity and readability is what we need.

For corrections pull requests or comments here on github are more than welcome.

For a more private conversation, email me.
